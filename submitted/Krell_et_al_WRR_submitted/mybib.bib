              future climate on timescales of two to three months. Where this
              information is not presently used it is difficult to evaluate the
              impact it might have. In order to justify disseminating the
              information to marginal groups it is important that the potential
              impact of the forecast is explored so that the negative and
              positive effects are at least partially appreciated before use of
              the information is widely promoted. We use an agent-based social
              simulation model, based on empirical evidence from field work in
              Lesotho, to assess the impact of using seasonal forecasts among
              smallholder farmers. The impact of using the forecast depends on
              the agents' initial household characteristics, what options they
              choose in responding to the forecast and the trust they place in
              the forecast (which in turn depends on their ability to learn and
              to follow their neighbours). Interaction of climate, crop
              productivity and social factors determines how much
              household-agents benefit or lose, evaluated in terms of crop
              yields and likelihood of exhausting food storage. Adoption of the
              forecast has the potential to decrease starvation among marginal
              household-agents but poor forecasts may do more harm than good.
              This work suggests that if forecasts are not correct more than
              60--70\% of the time, then they are unlikely to benefit poor
              farmers. Poor forecasts, or forecasts that fail badly, when they
              do fail, lead to longer adoption timescales for forecast use.
              Further investigation into the impact of the forecast at the
              village level is encouraged before dissemination is actively
              pursued without appreciating potential impacts.",

              very diverse physiological characteristics of the existing plants
              give rise to different strategies of soil moisture exploitation.
              Notwithstanding these differences, the vegetation water stress
              for all the species turns out to be very similar, suggesting that
              coexistence might be attained also through differentiation of
              water use. The case of the savanna of Southern Texas points out
              how rooting depth and interannual rainfall variability can impact
              soil moisture dynamics and vegetation water stress. Because of
              the different responses to water stress of trees and grasses,
              external climatic forcing could be at the origin of the dynamic
              equilibrium allowing coexistence in this ecosystem. Finally, the
              analysis of a short grass steppe in Colorado provides an
              interesting example of the so-called inverse texture effect,
              whereby preferential conditions for vegetation are dependent on
              soil texture and rainfall. Sites which are more favorable during
              wet conditions may become less suitable to the same vegetation
              type during drier years. Such an effect is important to explain

              presents results from participatory research with farmers from
              two agro-ecological zones of Senegal, West Africa. Based on
              simulation exercises, the introduction of seasonal and dekadal
              forecasts induced changes in farmers' practices in almost 75\% of
              the cases. Responses were categorized as either implying pure
              intensification of cropping systems (21\% of cases),
              non-intensified strategies (31\%) or a mix of both (24\%). Among
              non-intensified strategies, the most common forecast uses are
              changes in sowing date and crop variety with the latter being
              more prevalent where a wider repertoire of varieties existed.
              Mixed strategies generally used more inputs like manure or
              chemical fertilizers coupled with another strategy such as
              changing sowing date. Yield estimates suggest that forecast use
              led to yield gains in about one-third of the cases, with
              relatively few losses. Impacts varied according to the nature of
              the actual rainy season, forecasts accuracy and the type of
              response, positive ones being higher in wetter years, with
              intensified strategies and with accurate predictions. These

              able to help Senegalese farmers adapt to climate variability,

  abstract = "Changes in both the mean and the variability of climate, whether
              naturally forced, or due to human activities, pose a threat to
              crop production globally. This paper summarizes discussions of
              this issue at a meeting of the Royal Society in April 2005.
              Recent advances in understanding the sensitivity of crops to
              weather, climate and the levels of particular gases in the
              atmosphere indicate that the impact of these factors on crop
              yields and quality may be more severe than previously thought.
              There is increasing information on the importance to crop yields
              of extremes of temperature and rainfall at key stages of crop
              development. Agriculture will itself impact on the climate system
              and a greater understanding of these feedbacks is needed. Complex
              models are required to perform simulations of climate variability
              and change, together with predictions of how crops will respond
              to different climate variables. Variability of climate, such as
              that associated with El Ni{\~n}o events, has large impacts on
              crop production. If skilful predictions of the probability of
              such events occurring can be made a season or more in advance,
              then agricultural and other societal responses can be made. The
              development of strategies to adapt to variations in the current
              climate may also build resilience to changes in future climate.
              Africa will be the part of the world that is most vulnerable to
              climate variability and change, but knowledge of how to use
              climate information and the regional impacts of climate
              variability and change in Africa is rudimentary. In order to
              develop appropriate adaptation strategies globally, predictions
              about changes in the quantity and quality of food crops need to
              be considered in the context of the entire food chain from
              production to distribution, access and utilization.

              rely significantly on rain-fed agriculture, it is critical to
              examine climate variability and food insecurity. We utilize data
              from smallholder farmer surveys from 12 countries with 30 years
              of rainfall data to examine how rainfall variability and
              household resources are correlated with food security. We find
              that on average, households that experienced a drier than average
              year are 3.81 months food insecure, while households within a
              normal range of rainfall were 3.67 months food insecure, and
              wetter than average households were 2.86 months food insecure.
              Reduced odds of food insecurity is associated with agricultural
              inputs, ownership of livestock, water use efficiency, financial
              services, and participation in a group. However, in drier than
              average households, financial services as compared to
              agricultural inputs and agroecological practices have a greater

              agricultural inputs are more common for reduced food insecurity

              agricultural sector and for international agricultural markets.
              Climate variability in Spain is represented by the observed
              variability over a 30 year history. We assume perfect accuracy of
              seasonal climate forecasting but distinguish conservative and
              proactive crop mix adjustments. We also contrast nationally
              restricted dissemination of Spanish climate forecasts versus
              global dissemination. Averaged over the simulated climate states,
              the global benefits of Spanish climate forecasts range between 61
              and 189 million US\$ per year. Agricultural consumers in Spain
              gain between 0.8 and 2.9 percent and Spanish farm revenues
              increase between 1.9 and 7.0 percent. If Spanish farmers consider
              crop mix choices outside historical bounds (proactive reaction)
              their revenues are notably higher than otherwise (conservative
              reaction). The VOI under favorable climate conditions is greater
              than under adverse climate conditions. When adverse climate
              conditions are forecast, negative VOI could materialize for the
              Spanish farmers because of production and welfare transfers from
              Spain to other countries. Information sharing of Spanish climate
              predictions with the rest of the world (ROW) increases not only
              global welfare but also Spanish producers' benefits. Finally,
              climate forecasting promotes a more efficient use of agricultural
              resources. The agricultural efficiency increase due to climate
              forecasts translates into welfare-neutral land savings of 2
              percent in Spain.",

              that is grown locally. Developing countries with weak purchasing
              power tend to import as little food as possible from global
              markets, suffering consumption deficits during times of high
              prices or production declines. Local agricultural production,
              therefore, is critical to both food security and economic
              development among the rural poor. The level of local agricultural
              production, in turn, will be determined by the amount and quality
              of arable land, the amount and quality of agricultural inputs
              (fertilizer, seeds, pesticides, etc.), as well as farm-related
              technology, practices and policies. This paper discusses several
              emerging threats to global and regional food security, including
              declining yield gains that are failing to keep up with population
              increases, and warming in the tropical Indian Ocean and its
              impact on rainfall. If yields continue to grow more slowly than
              per capita harvested area, parts of Africa, Asia and Central and
              Southern America will experience substantial declines in per
              capita cereal production. Global per capita cereal production
              will potentially decline by 14\% between 2008 and 2030. Climate
              change is likely to further affect food production, particularly
              in regions that have very low yields due to lack of technology.
              Drought, caused by anthropogenic warming in the Indian and
              Pacific Oceans, may also reduce 21st century food availability in
              some countries by disrupting moisture transports and bringing
              down dry air over crop growing areas. The impacts of these
              circulation changes over Asia remain uncertain. For Africa,

  abstract = "Climatic conditions and hence climate change influence
              agriculture. Most studies that addressed the vulnerability of
              agriculture to climate change have focused on potential impacts
              without considering adaptation. When adaptation strategies are
              considered, socio-economic conditions and farm management are
              often ignored, but these strongly influence current farm
              performance and are likely to also influence adaptation to future
              changes. This study analysed the adaptation of farmers and
              regions in the European Union to prevailing climatic conditions,
              climate change and climate variability in the last decades
              (1990--2003) in the context of other conditions and changes. We
              compared (1) responses in crop yields with responses in farmers'
              income, (2) responses to spatial climate variability with
              responses to temporal climate variability, (3) farm level
              responses with regional level responses and (4) potential climate
              impacts (based on crop models) with actual climate impacts (based
              on farm accountancy data). Results indicated that impacts on crop
              yields cannot directly be translated to impacts on farmers'
              income, as farmers adapt by changing crop rotations and inputs.
              Secondly, the impacts of climatic conditions on spatial
              variability in crop yields and farmers' income, with generally
              lower yields in warmer climates, is different from the impacts of
              temporal variability in climate, for which more heterogeneous
              patterns are observed across regions in Europe. Thirdly, actual
              impacts of climate change and variability are largely dependent
              on farm characteristics (e.g. intensity, size, land use), which
              influence management and adaptation. To accurately understand
              impacts and adaptation, assessments should consider responses at
              different levels of organization. As different farm types adapt
              differently, a larger diversity in farm types reduces impacts of
              climate variability at regional level, but certain farm types may
              still be vulnerable. Lastly, we observed that management and
              adaptation can largely reduce the potential impacts of climate
              change and climate variability on crop yields and farmers'
              income. We conclude that for reliable projections of the impacts
              of climate change on agriculture, adaptation should not be seen
              anymore as a last step in a vulnerability assessment, but as
              integrated part of the models used to simulate crop yields,

              strategies are generalizable or vary across regions. In this
              study we ask about three potential key factors influencing
              farming households' ability to adapt: access to weather
              information, household and agricultural production-related
              assets, and participation in local social institutions. We use a
              12-country data set from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to
              explore the links between these three potential drivers of
              agricultural change and the likelihood that farmers made
              farm-associated changes, such as adopting improved crop
              varieties, increasing fertilizer use, investing in improved land
              management practices, and changing the timing of agricultural
              activities. We find evidence that access to weather information,

              recent years, although these results vary across countries and

@article{Ray2015,
abstract = {Many studies have examined the role of mean climate change in agriculture, but an understanding of the influence of inter-annual climate variations on crop yields in different regions remains elusive. We use detailed crop statistics time series for {\~{}}13,500 political units to examine how recent climate variability led to variations in maize, rice, wheat and soybean crop yields worldwide. While some areas show no significant influence of climate variability, in substantial areas of the global breadbaskets, {\textgreater}60{\%} of the yield variability can be explained by climate variability. Globally, climate variability accounts for roughly a third ({\~{}}32-39{\%}) of the observed yield variability. Our study uniquely illustrates spatial patterns in the relationship between climate variability and crop yield variability, highlighting where variations in temperature, precipitation or their interaction explain yield variability. We discuss key drivers for the observed variations to target further research and policy interventions geared towards buffering future crop production from climate variability.},
