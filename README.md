# maize-Toff
Repo for modeling analysis of maize yield variability and tradeoffs between yield and crop failure.

## Research questions
1. What are the tradeoffs between yield (i.e. cultivar or variety selection), planting date, and crop failure?
2. To what extent does temperature and precipitation variability drive variability in crop production?

## Set-up
1. ```cd maize-Toff```
2. ```conda activate scibase```
3. ```jupyter notebook```

## Directory structure

### py/
* where models are stored

### dat/
* contains CETRAD rainfall data, maize variety info, survey info...
