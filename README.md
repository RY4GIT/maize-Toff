# maize-Toff
Repo for modeling analysis of of maize yield variability and tradeoffs between yield and crop failure.

## Research questions
1. What are the tradeoffs between yield (i.e. cultivar or variety selection), planting date, and crop failure?
2. To what extent does temperature and precipitation variability drive variability in crop production?

## Set-up
1. ```cd maize-Toff```
2. ```conda env update --name maize-Toff --file RTR_copy/binder/environment.yml```
2. ```conda activate maize-Toff```
3. ```jupyter notebook```

## Directory structure

### RTR_copy/
* direct copy of RidgeToReef notebooks which contain model in Ch.3

### dat/
* contains CETRAD rainfall data, maize variety info, survey info...
